# Our prod requirements come from setup.py, but we use this file to pin
# a specific version of ctds for linux.  We setup.py/pip-tools does not handle
# environment markers, so we do it here in an additional .in file.
#
# This is a pre-built wheel of cTDS, which supports accessing MSSQL databases
# using the TDS protocol.  We're using this because we had problems downloading
# large amounts of data over ODBC.  If you're on a platform other than Linux
# then you'll have to install cTDS yourself:
